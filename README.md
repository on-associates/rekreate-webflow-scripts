### Updating scripts and deploying  

This script needs to be used externally with Webflow, because Webflow has a limitation of 10,000 characters and this javascript file exceed that. Every time you make changes, please remember to update <script src=""></script> tag url, in the steps provided below:

- Select the repository you want to use and copy the url, for example: https://github.com/on-associates/rekreate-webflow-scripts/blob/main/video.min.js
- Open this link: [raw.githack](https://raw.githack.com/) and paste the url to create a cdn.
- Insert the production url between the <script src=""></script> tags in Webflow.
